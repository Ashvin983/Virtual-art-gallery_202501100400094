# 🎨 Art Gallery Website  

This project is a **simple static website** built using **only HTML**.  
It is designed as a digital art gallery that showcases different kinds of artworks, including **paintings, digital art, photography, and DIY crafts**.  

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to structure a webpage using fundamental HTML elements without CSS or JavaScript.

## ✨ Features  

### 1. HTML Boilerplate  
- Includes `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<body>` tags.  
- Uses `<meta charset="UTF-8">` for character encoding and `<meta name="viewport">` for responsiveness.  

### 2. Title & Introduction  
- A main heading (`<h1>My Art Gallery</h1>`) introduces the site.  
- A paragraph introduces the artworks, highlighting **paintings**, *photographs*, and <u>digital creations</u>.  
- Example of deleted text using `<del>` (to show old gallery removed).  

### 3. Artworks Section  
Five artworks are displayed with headings, images, captions, and internal navigation links:  
1. **Painting** – Serenity framed art.  
2. **The Persistence of Memory** – A famous art representation.  
3. **Digital Abstract Art** – 3D-styled digital art.  
4. **Nature Photography** – A mountain landscape photo.  
5. **Handmade DIY Craft** – Creative handmade craftwork.  

Each artwork has:  
- An `<h2>` heading with `id` attributes (for jump links).  
- An `<img>` with `src`, `alt`, `width`, and `height`.  
- An internal `<a href="#artX">` link to navigate back to each section.  

### 4. External Link  
- A link to **[The Metropolitan Museum of Art](https://www.metmuseum.org)** opens in a new tab (`target="_blank"`).  

### 5. Ordered List (Steps to Create Art)  
- Uses `<ol type="I">` for Roman numerals.  
- Demonstrates custom numbering with `value="5"`.  

### 6. Unordered List (Materials Used)  
- Uses `<ul type="circle">` for bullet points.  
- Lists art materials like paints, brushes, canvas, paper, and colors.  

### 7. Table (Artwork Comparison)  
- A `<table>` with borders, cell padding, and cell spacing.  
- Compares each artwork by **title, medium, and year**.
